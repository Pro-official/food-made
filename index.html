            <p>Life would be so much easier if we didn't have boundaries in consuming food. In my opinion, "food

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are hoping to start a revolution of 'free food for forever.' We believe, food is a diving gift from
                God almighty and that should not be kept aside for only the rich people. Poor people deserve food better
                than anyone else in this world.</p>
